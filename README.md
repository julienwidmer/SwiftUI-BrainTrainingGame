# SwiftUI - Brain Training Game
A game where the player has to select the correct rock 👊️, paper ✋ or scissors ✌️ move to collect points.

The game has ten rounds and will ask the user for a "losing" or "winning" move, meaning that the player could lose points 
if they select "rock against scissors" instead of "paper against scissors" if the game requests a "losing" move.
